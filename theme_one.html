		<ul style="color:white">
			<li> John Cage</li>
			<li> Sister Corita Kent</li>
		</ul>
		<p style="color:white"> Rule One: Find a place you trust, and try trusting it for awhile.</p>
		
		<p style="color:white"> Rule Two: General duties of a student - pull everything out of your teacher; pull everything out of your fellow students.</p>
		
		<p style="color:white"> Rule Three: General duties of a teacher: pull everything out of your students.</p>
		
		<p style="color:white"> Rule Four: Consider everything an experiment.</p> 
		
		<p style="color:white"> Rule Five: Be self-disciplined - this means finding someone wise or smart and choosing to follow them. To be disciplined is to follow in a good way. To be self-disciplined is to follow in a better way.</p>
		
		<p style="color:white"> Rule Six: Nothing is a mistake. There's no win and no fall, there's only make.</p>
		
		<p style="color:white"> Rule Seven: The only rule is work. If you work it will lead to something. It's people who do all work all of the time who eventually catch on to things.</p>
		
		<p style="color:white"> Rule Eight: Don't try to create and analyze at the same time. They're different processes.</p>
		
		<p style="color:white"> Rule Nine: Be happy whenever you can manage it. Enjoy yourself. It's lighter than you think.</p>
		
		<p style="color:white"> Rule Ten: "We're breaking all the rules. Even our own rules. And how do we do that? By leaving plenty of room for X quantities."</p>
		
		<p style="color:white"> HELPFUL HINTS: Always be around. Come or go to every-thing. Always go to classes. Read anything you can get your hands on. Look at movies carefully, often.</p>
		<p style="color:white"> Save everything - it might come in handy later.</p>
		
		<p style="color:white"> There should be new rules next week.</p>
